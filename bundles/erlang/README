User configuration notes
========================

Below is a quick guide to necessary configurations for getting
yourself started with Emacs. Please refer to the complete
documentation for details.



For UNIX users
--------------

Below is a complete example of what should be added to a user's .emacs file,
provided that OTP is installed in the directory /usr/local/otp. 

The .emacs file is found/placed in the user's home directory.


Please replace /usr/local/otp in the example below with the path to
the OTP installation on your system.

;; For UNIX
(setq load-path (cons  "/usr/local/otp/misc/emacs"
                       load-path))
(setq erlang-root-dir "/usr/local/otp")
(setq exec-path (cons "/usr/local/otp/bin" exec-path))
(require 'erlang-start)



For Windows users
-----------------

Note for Windows users: In .emacs, the slash character "/" can be used
as path separator. But if you decide to use the backslash character
"\", please not that you must use double backslashes, since they are
treated as escape characters by Emacs.


Below is a complete example of what should be added to a user's .emacs file,
provided that OTP is installed in the directory C:\Program Files\erl-4.7. 

The .emacs file is found/placed in the directory indicated by the environment variable HOME, if it is defined. Otherwise it is found/placed in the root directory, C:\.

Please replace C:/Program Files/erl-4.7 in the example below with the path to
the OTP installation on your system.

;; For Windows
(setq load-path (cons  "C:/Program Files/erl-4.7/misc/emacs"
                       load-path))
(setq erlang-root-dir "C:/Program Files/erl-4.7")
(setq exec-path (cons "C:/Program Files/erl-4.7/bin" exec-path))
(require 'erlang-start)
