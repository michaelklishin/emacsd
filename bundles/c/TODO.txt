Things to do
============

- optimizations

- class completion

- skip stuff in comments and strings

- handle namespace of classes retrieved from source. now everything in
  the source is considered to be in the same namespace

- handle name lookup for embedded classes and types

- handle enum

- handle [][]

- auto help (with internal error handling)

- handle out/ref parameters

- function invocation should check the type of invocation arguments
  too if possible to narrow down the list of possible overloads

- overloaded function argument can be base/derived types too

- handling scopes without blocks when scoping an other control structure

  e.g.       foreach (Items item ... )
                if (stuff)
                {
                     ;; item is not detected here
                }

- handle casting

- overloading methods with default parameter values

- skip construtor initializers when parsing function argument
   ...) : base()... 

- using explicit full or partial namespaces as prefix
  (e.g. System.Console after "using System;")

- function doc for generic methods (e.g. List.Add)

  M:System.Collections.Generic.List`1.Add(`0)

  what is `0? probably reflection should be used to handle generic
  stuff properly

- check all forward/backward-sexps for error checking

  or maybe they should be left as is, so that the user is notified of
  syntax errors?

- tooltip is hidden immediately if mouse cursor is in the way, though
  the cursor is moved away first. why is that?

- extract return value documentation from assemblies

- extract thrown exception documentation from assemblies

- constructors without any modifier are not handled (they are private
  and private constrcutors are not that useful, so it may not be a big
  deal)
