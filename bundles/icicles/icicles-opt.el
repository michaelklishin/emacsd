;;  For descriptions of changes to this file, see `icicles-chg.el'.
;;
;;  Note that occasionally I have renamed or removed an Icicles
;;  option.  If you have customized such an option, then your
;;  customization will no longer have any effect.  With the exception
;;  of options `icicle-mode' and `icicle-mode-hook', library
;;  `icicles-opt.el' always contains the complete set of Icicles
;;  options.  If your custom file or init file contains an Icicles
;;  option that is not listed above, then you can remove it because it
;;  is obsolete.

;;  If you have library `linkd.el' and Emacs 22 or later, load

  "*Non-nil means to add the buffer name to completion candidates.
This means that for some Icicles commands, such as `icicle-search' and
`icicle-select-region', the normal completion candidate is treated as
a multi-completion: the name of the buffer associated with it is added
to the candidate and highlighted.

The main advantage is that you can easily see which buffer a candidate
applies to.  Also, the buffer name is part of the candidate, so you
can match against it.

Note that even when the value is nil, you can use `C-M-mouse-2' and so
on to see information about a candidate, and this information includes
its buffer name whenever a non-nil value would have shown the buffer
name."

  "*Non-nil means to include proxy candidates whenever possible.
A proxy candidate is a special candidate (shown in *Completions* using
face `icicle-special-candidate') whose name is a placeholder for the
real candidate.  The proxy candidate typically stands for some value
obtained from the cursor position or by some action such as clicking
the mouse.  Example candidates include a color or file name, named by
proxy candidates such as `*copied foreground*' or `*file at point*'.

You can toggle this option at any time from the minibuffer using
`\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\\[icicle-toggle-proxy-candidates]'.  However, for \
commands that provide many proxy candidates, if
the flag is off initially when input is read, then you must re-invoke
the completing command for the new value to take effect.  (This is for
performance reasons.)"

actions for the same candidate, within a single invocation of
`icicle-anything' (or related commands).

  "List of top-level commands to bind in Icicle mode.
Each list element is of custom type `icicle-key-definition' and has
the form (KEY COMMAND CONDITION).

KEY is either a key sequence (string or vector) to bind COMMAND to or
a command to remap to COMMAND.
COMMAND is bound according to the value of KEY, unless the result of
evaluating CONDITION is nil.

In Customize, to specify a key sequence, choose `Key' in the `Value
Menu', then enter a key description such as that returned by `C-h k'.
For convenience, you can use insert each key in the key description by
hitting `C-q' then the key.  For example, to enter the key description
`C-c M-k' you can use `C-q C-c C-q M-k'.

If you customize this option, then you must exit and re-enter Icicle
mode to ensure that the change takes effect.  This is really necessary
only if your changes would undefine a key.

For this option to have an effect upon startup, it must be set before
you enter Icicle mode.  This means that you must ensure that the code
that sets it is invoked before you enter Icicle mode.  If you use
Customize to change this option, then ensure that the code inserted by
Customize into your `user-init-file' or your `custom-file' is invoked
before you enter Icicle mode."

  "*How to treat the default value when reading minibuffer input.

When the default value argument to functions such as
`completing-read', `read-file-name', `read-from-minibuffer', and
`read-string' is non-nil and the initial-input argument is nil or
\"\", the default value can be added to the prompt as a hint or
inserted into the minibuffer as the initial input.

Adding it to the prompt is the default behavior and corresponds to the
behavior of vanilla Emacs.

Inserting the default value in the minibuffer as the initial input has
the advantage of not requiring you to use `M-n' to retrieve it.  It
has the disadvantage of making you use `M-p' (or do something else) to
get rid of the default value in the minibuffer if you do not want to
use or edit it.  If you often want to use or edit the default value,
then set `icicle-default-value' to non-nil and non-t.  If you rarely
do so, then set it to nil or t.

If inserted in the minibuffer, the value of this option also
determines whether or not the inserted text is preselected and where
the cursor is left: at the beginning or end of the text.

These are the possible option values:

  nil               - Do not insert default value or add it to prompt.
  t                 - Add default value to prompt.  Do not insert it.
  `insert-start'    - Insert default value and leave cursor at start.
  `insert-end'      - Insert default value and leave cursor at end.
  `preselect-start' - Insert and preselect default value;
                      leave cursor at beginning.
  `preselect-end'   - Insert and preselect default value;
                      leave cursor at end.

My own preference is `insert-end'.

Preselection can be useful in Delete Selection mode or PC Selection
mode.  It makes it easy to replace the value by typing characters, or
delete it by hitting `C-d' or `DEL' (backspace).  However, all of the
initial input is lost if you type or hit `C-d' or `DEL'.  That is
inconvenient if you want to keep most of it and edit it only slightly."

This highlighting can have a negative impact on performance, because
it can mean recomputing completion candidates multiple times, in order

this option and options
`icicle-highlight-input-completion-failure-delay' and

the highlighting can take place.

In particular, highlighting the non-matching part of remote file names
can be slow.  Two values of this option allow remote file name
highlighting: `always' and `explicit-remote'.  The other values do not
highlight remote file names.  You probably do not want to use a value
of `always'.

If the value is nil, then highlighting never occurs.  If the value is
`explicit-strict', `explicit', or `explicit-remote', then highlighting
occurs only upon demand: when you hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to request
completion.  If the value is `implicit-strict', `implicit', or
`always', then highlighting occurs also when you update your input
during incremental completion.

If the value is `implicit-strict' or `implicit', then highlighting
occurs only if `icicle-incremental-completion-flag' is non-nil.
Remember that you can toggle incremental completion, using `C-#' in

  "*String joining items in a completion that is a list of strings.
When a completion candidate is a list of strings, this string is used
to join the strings in the list, for display and matching purposes.
When completing input, you type regexps that match the strings,
separating them pairwise by the value of `icicle-list-join-string'.
Actually, what you enter is interpreted as a single regexp to be
matched against the joined strings.  Typically, the candidate list
contains two strings: a name and its doc string.

A good value for this option is a string that:
 1) does not normally occur in doc strings,
 2) visually separates the two strings it joins, and
 3) is not too difficult or too long to type.

The default value is \"^G\^J\", that is, control-g followed by
control-j (newline):
 1) ^G does not normally occur in doc strings
 2) a newline visually separates the multiple component strings, which
    helps readability in buffer *Completions*
 3) you can type the value using `C-q C-g C-q C-j'.

For readability (in Emacs 22 and later), the default value has a
`display' property that makes it appear as simply a newline in
*Completions* - the `^G' is hidden.  you can also make the default
